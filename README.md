Stacked meta-ensemble that predicts **21-day log-domain market-relative alpha** (`canonical_predicted_alpha` field, post-2026-05-09 cutover) for each ticker. Three Layer-1 specialized models — LightGBM momentum, LightGBM volatility, and a research-score calibrator — feed a Layer-2 Ridge meta-learner alongside research-context and raw macro features. Outputs UP/FLAT/DOWN with a confidence score and a veto gate that blocks high-confidence DOWN entries.

## What this does

- **Stacked meta-ensemble** — three Layer-1 specialized models (LightGBM momentum + LightGBM volatility + research-score calibrator) plus research-context and raw macro features feed a Layer-2 Ridge meta-learner. v3.0 architecture deployed 2026-04-01.
- **Sector-neutral training** — labels are `alpha = log(stock_21d_return) − log(sector_etf_21d_return)` (canonical log-domain post-2026-05-09 cutover) with cross-sectional rank normalization and 5-fold walk-forward validation. Promotion gate requires both ensemble IC and per-component subsample IC to pass.
- **Daily inference** — loads ensemble weights from S3, fetches prices (slim cache + daily_closes delta), recomputes features from scratch each morning so predictions shift even when the model is frozen between weekly retrains.
- **Veto gate** — high-confidence DOWN predictions override BUY signals from Research, gating the Executor against entering declining positions. Threshold is auto-tuned weekly by the Backtester.
- **Named-baseline discipline** — every Layer-1 component must clear an explicit named baseline before contributing to L2; the prior 4th L1 (regime classifier) was pruned 2026-04-16 after walk-forward validation showed sub-majority-class accuracy.

## Phase 2 measurement contribution

Predictor outputs are the quantitative layer on top of Research signals. Phase 2 contribution: every prediction is captured with its full feature vector, per-component L1 votes, L2 meta-learner score, confidence, and veto-gate decision. Per-component IC tracking lets the system tell whether a regression in ensemble IC is driven by one underperforming layer or by a regime shift across all of them. The substrate that lets Phase 3 retire or upgrade individual L1 components without destabilizing the stack.

Veto gate fires when DOWN confidence exceeds the auto-tuned threshold; Executor honors the veto on its next planning cycle.

## Configuration

This repo is **public**. Hyperparameters, confidence thresholds, and tuned ensemble weights live in the private [`alpha-engine-config`](https://github.com/cipher813/alpha-engine-config) repo and are auto-applied weekly by the Backtester via `s3://alpha-engine-research/config/predictor_params.json`. Architecture and approach are public; specific values are private.
