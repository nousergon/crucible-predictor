# Dockerfile — Lambda container image for alpha-engine-predictor.
#
# LightGBM + CatBoost inference with Platt calibration.
# Training runs on EC2 spot (spot_train.sh); Lambda is inference-only.
# Container image is ~500MB (LightGBM + CatBoost + scikit-learn).
#
# Build:
#   docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t alpha-engine-predictor .
#
# Run locally (simulates Lambda):
#   docker run -p 9000:8080 alpha-engine-predictor
#   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations \
#        -d '{"dry_run": true}'
#
# The CMD points to inference.handler.handler, matching the Lambda handler
# configuration in infrastructure/deploy.sh.

# Bake the source commit SHA into the image so PredictorPreflight can detect
# deploy drift (deployed SHA vs origin/main HEAD). Passed by deploy.sh via
# `--build-arg GIT_SHA=<sha>` (CI uses $GITHUB_SHA; local dev defaults to
# `git rev-parse HEAD`). A file is chosen over an env var so the stamp
# travels with the image artifact itself — you can't have a "deployed image"
# with a different stamp than what was baked.

# Copy and install Python requirements first for better layer caching.
# alpha-engine-lib is pinned in requirements-lambda.txt (single source of
# truth for the Lambda image — keep in lockstep with the project-root
# requirements.txt). The standalone install line previously here drifted
# behind requirements.txt and shipped v0.2.4 to prod even after the
# project pin moved to v0.5.5; consolidating prevents a repeat (see
# `feedback_two_doc_sources_two_staleness_vectors`).

# Regime substrate (v3) — standalone submodule independent of model/.
# Same image serves both inference Lambda (CMD=inference.handler.handler)

# regime.handler.lambda_handler), mirroring the shared-image pattern
# alpha-engine-research uses for eval-judge + rationale-clustering.

# module-top of inference/handler.py. The path resolves via:
#   os.environ.get("LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT", os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(...)))
# Mirrors alpha-engine-research / alpha-engine-data Dockerfiles.
# (flow-doctor-training.yaml is NOT shipped here — training runs on EC2
# spot, not Lambda; that yaml is read from the repo root via the local
# checkout that spot_train.sh sets up.)
