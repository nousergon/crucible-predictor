"""Deploy-drift probe: confirm Step Function + CloudFormation deployed SHAs
match `origin/main` HEAD for their source repos.

Exposed as `action=check_deploy_drift` on the predictor Lambda handler so
the weekday Step Function can invoke it as a Task state before any real
work runs. Keeps the check-surface in one Lambda rather than deploying a
new one for a ~100-line concern; architectural split can happen later if
this Lambda's surface grows.

Returns a JSON-serializable dict the SF consumes via a Choice state.
