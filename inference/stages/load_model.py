"""Stage: load_model — Load v3 meta-model weights from S3 / local cache.

The v2 single-GBM and multi-horizon-ensemble inference paths were retired
2026-04-13 when ``train_handler`` collapsed its dispatcher to
``run_meta_training()``. The corresponding inference loaders
(``_load_gbm`` + ``load_gbm_local`` + ``load_gbm_s3``) plus their
config switches (``GBM_ENSEMBLE_LAMBDARANK``, ``MULTI_HORIZON_*``,
``CATBOOST_*``) were deleted in the v2 cleanup PR after a clean grep
confirmed v3's ``_load_meta_models`` was the sole consumer reachable in
production. ``META_MODEL_ENABLED`` is hardcoded ``true`` in the config
repo, so the dispatcher's else-branch was dead code.
