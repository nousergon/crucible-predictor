"""Heuristic stance classifier — derives per-pick stance loadings from
precomputed features and emits BOTH continuous loadings AND the
dominant discrete label.

Stance taxonomy: 4-element closed vocabulary (``momentum`` / ``value`` /
``quality`` / ``catalyst``) defined in
``nousergon_lib.agent_schemas.StanceLiteral``. Loadings shape lives
in ``StanceLoadings``. This module's job: assign loadings + dominant
stance to each ticker the predictor scores so the executor can route
to stance-appropriate gates without the LLM agents needing to self-tag.

**Why continuous + dominant (institutional pattern)**: factor models at
Barra / AQR / Fama-French / BlackRock Aladdin derive CONTINUOUS factor
loadings from data — they don't force a single-stance assignment. Most
picks have mixed exposure (e.g., 0.65 momentum + 0.20 quality +
0.10 value + 0.05 catalyst). Discrete labels alone force an artificial
single-choice when reality is mixed. We emit both:
  - ``stance_loadings`` (continuous) for institutional-grade consumers
  - ``stance`` (discrete, argmax) for simple v1 consumers

**Why heuristic v1 (not ML)**:
  * No labeled training data yet (first time stance gets tagged).
  * Heuristic rules → smooth functions → transparent calibration.
  * ML upgrade (multi-class classifier with calibrated softmax) is
    roadmapped as P3 in alpha-engine-config ROADMAP. The continuous
    shape this v1 emits is a drop-in compatible target for the ML
    model — no future schema migration required.

Threshold / scale parameters below are ad hoc cold-start values.
Backtester (stance-arc PR 4) adds them to the parameter search space
once 4+ weeks of stance-tagged history accumulates; values auto-tune
weekly from then.
