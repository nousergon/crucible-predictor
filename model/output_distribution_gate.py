"""Output-distribution gate (audit Phase 2a).

Validates that a calibrator produces a non-degenerate output distribution
on a synthetic alpha sweep before the model is promoted to live or used
for inference. Catches the calibrator-plateau / saturation / direction-skew
class of failure that bit production on 2026-04-28, 2026-05-04, and
2026-05-07.

Two execution sites are supported by the same gate logic:

- **Promotion-time** (training/meta_trainer.py, audit Phase 2a-PROMOTE):
  blocks live promotion of weights when the calibrator output collapses
  on a synthetic input sweep. Same architectural class as the existing
  IC gate and per-component subsample gate at meta_trainer.py:1019.

- **Inference-time** (inference/handler.py, audit Phase 2a-INFER):
  fails closed if the calibrator output collapses on the live batch's
  predicted alphas. Replaces the post-hoc variance fallback rescue path
  with refuse-to-write — predictions.json isn't written; executor reads
  prior-day fallback. (PR-INFER follows this PR; this module exposes
  the helper that both sites call.)

This first PR ships the gate logic + the synthetic-sweep variant
(audit's §9.2 Option B). The stratified-historical-sample variant
(Option C) and the inference-time integration follow in subsequent PRs.

    """Run an evenly-spaced synthetic alpha sweep through the calibrator and
    check four distribution-shape invariants.

    The four checks (and what they catch):

    1. **Unique p_up values** — the calibrator should produce at least
       ``min_unique_p_up`` distinct outputs across the synthetic sweep.
       Catches the isotonic-plateau failure mode (16 of 27 tickers all
       at p_up=0.458, 2026-05-07): the calibrator learned a flat region
       in the raw-alpha space and maps any input in that region to the
       same output.

    2. **Saturation rate** — at most ``max_saturation_rate`` of outputs
       can sit at the calibrator's floor (0.01) or ceiling (0.99) clip
       boundaries. Catches the floor-clipping mode (5 of 27 tickers all
       at p_up=0.010, conf=0.99 on 2026-05-07): every input below the
       calibrator's learned minimum maps to the same saturated value,
       which is operationally equivalent to "this ticker is in the
       bottom-N alpha bucket" but reads as "high confidence DOWN".

    3. **Output stdev** — the calibrator's outputs across the sweep
       must have ``min_stdev`` standard deviation. Catches the
       compressed-output failure (all p_up close to 0.5119 on
       2026-04-28): when training data hardcoded constants for research
       features, the meta-Ridge produced a near-constant output and
       isotonic mapped everything to a tight cluster.

    4. **Direction skew** — the implied direction (p_up > 0.5 → UP,
       < 0.5 → DOWN) shouldn't be ``max_direction_skew`` or more on one
       side. Catches the false-collapse failure (0 UP / 26 DOWN on
       2026-05-04): when the upstream model produces a degenerate
       output, the calibrator faithfully maps it all to one direction.

    Returns OutputDistributionGateResult. Pass-on-fitted-calibrator-only:
    if the calibrator isn't fitted (linear fallback path), the gate
    returns ``passed=True`` with a metrics dict showing zero unique
    values from the sweep — the linear fallback's monotonic continuous
    output is the desired behavior in that case.

    Args:
        calibrator: An object exposing ``calibrate_prediction(raw_alpha)``
            returning a dict with ``"p_up"`` and ``"predicted_direction"``.
            Both PlattCalibrator and IsotonicCalibrator from model/calibrator.py
            satisfy this. Caller passes the calibrator under test.
        alpha_range: (low, high) bounds for the synthetic sweep. Default
            (-0.05, +0.05) covers the typical operating range; tighten
            to (-0.02, +0.02) for a more sensitive plateau check around
            the calibrator's high-density region.
        n_synthetic: Number of evenly-spaced alphas in the sweep. Default
            25 is enough to detect plateaus while keeping the gate cheap
            (~25 calibrator calls = milliseconds).
        min_unique_p_up: Lower bound on distinct p_up values across the
            sweep. Default 8 (out of 25) means at least ~30% of the input
            range produces distinct outputs.
        max_saturation_rate: Upper bound on the fraction of outputs that
            sit at floor or ceiling. Default 0.25 = at most 1/4 of the
            sweep can be saturated.
        min_stdev: Lower bound on the stdev of the sweep's output. Default
            0.005 = output must spread at least ~1pp on the p_up scale.
        max_direction_skew: Upper bound on max(n_up, n_down) /
            (n_up + n_down). Default 0.85 = at most 85% same direction.
        floor: Calibrator floor clip value. Default 0.011 (1pp tolerance
            above isotonic's hard 0.01 floor for round-tripping).
        ceiling: Calibrator ceiling clip value. Default 0.989 (similar
            tolerance below 0.99 hard ceiling).

    applied to today's actual inference output rather than a synthetic

    calibrator itself is healthy on synthetic input — for example,

    Designed to be called from inference/stages/write_output.py at the
