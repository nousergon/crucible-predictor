"""Output-distribution gate (audit Phase 2a).

Validates that a calibrator produces a non-degenerate output distribution
on a synthetic alpha sweep before the model is promoted to live or used
for inference. Catches the calibrator-plateau / saturation / direction-skew
class of failure that bit production on 2026-04-28, 2026-05-04, and
2026-05-07.

Two execution sites are supported by the same gate logic:

- **Promotion-time** (training/meta_trainer.py, audit Phase 2a-PROMOTE):
  blocks live promotion of weights when the calibrator output collapses
  on a synthetic input sweep. Same architectural class as the existing
  IC gate and per-component subsample gate at meta_trainer.py:1019.

- **Inference-time** (inference/handler.py, audit Phase 2a-INFER):
  fails closed if the calibrator output collapses on the live batch's
  predicted alphas. Replaces the post-hoc variance fallback rescue path
  with refuse-to-write — predictions.json isn't written; executor reads
  prior-day fallback. (PR-INFER follows this PR; this module exposes
  the helper that both sites call.)

This first PR ships the gate logic + the synthetic-sweep variant
(audit's §9.2 Option B). The stratified-historical-sample variant
(Option C) and the inference-time integration follow in subsequent PRs.

    """Run an evenly-spaced synthetic alpha sweep through the calibrator and
    check four distribution-shape invariants.

    The four checks (and what they catch):

    1. **Flat-region collapse** — fires only when the output has BOTH a
       low distinct-value count (< ``min_unique_p_up``) AND a single
       dominant modal value (>= ``max_modal_fraction`` of the batch piled
       on one p_up). Catches the isotonic-plateau failure mode (16 of 27
       tickers all at p_up=0.458, 2026-05-07 → modal 59%): the calibrator
       learned a flat region and maps any input in it to the same output.
       The modal-concentration condition is what stops this check from
       false-halting on benign isotonic-staircase coarseness — an isotonic
       calibrator quantizes alpha→p_up into monotonic steps, so a thin or
       low-dispersion live batch legitimately lands in few distinct values
       with NO dominant mode (2026-06-22: 26 post-holiday tickers → 7
       monotonic steps spanning 0.35→0.70, modal 8/26=31% — healthy spread,
       must pass). Raw distinct-count alone cannot separate these.

    2. **Saturation rate** — at most ``max_saturation_rate`` of outputs
       can sit at the calibrator's floor (0.01) or ceiling (0.99) clip
       boundaries. Catches the floor-clipping mode (5 of 27 tickers all
       at p_up=0.010, conf=0.99 on 2026-05-07): every input below the
       calibrator's learned minimum maps to the same saturated value,
       which is operationally equivalent to "this ticker is in the
       bottom-N alpha bucket" but reads as "high confidence DOWN".

    3. **Output stdev** — the calibrator's outputs across the sweep
       must have ``min_stdev`` standard deviation. Catches the
       compressed-output failure (all p_up close to 0.5119 on
       2026-04-28): when training data hardcoded constants for research
       features, the meta-Ridge produced a near-constant output and
       isotonic mapped everything to a tight cluster.

    4. **Direction skew** — the implied direction (p_up > 0.5 → UP,
       < 0.5 → DOWN) shouldn't be ``max_direction_skew`` or more on one
       side. Catches the false-collapse failure (0 UP / 26 DOWN on
       2026-05-04): when the upstream model produces a degenerate
       output, the calibrator faithfully maps it all to one direction.

    Returns OutputDistributionGateResult. Pass-on-fitted-calibrator-only:
    if the calibrator isn't fitted (linear fallback path), the gate
    returns ``passed=True`` with a metrics dict showing zero unique
    values from the sweep — the linear fallback's monotonic continuous
    output is the desired behavior in that case.

    Args:
        calibrator: An object exposing ``calibrate_prediction(raw_alpha)``
            returning a dict with ``"p_up"`` and ``"predicted_direction"``.
            Both PlattCalibrator and IsotonicCalibrator from model/calibrator.py
            satisfy this. Caller passes the calibrator under test.
        alpha_range: (low, high) bounds for the synthetic sweep. Default
            (-0.05, +0.05) covers the typical operating range; tighten
            to (-0.02, +0.02) for a more sensitive plateau check around
            the calibrator's high-density region.
        n_synthetic: Number of evenly-spaced alphas in the sweep. Default
            25 is enough to detect plateaus while keeping the gate cheap
            (~25 calibrator calls = milliseconds).
        min_unique_p_up: Lower bound on distinct p_up values across the
            sweep. Default 8 (out of 25) means at least ~30% of the input
            range produces distinct outputs.
        max_saturation_rate: Upper bound on the fraction of outputs that
            sit at floor or ceiling. Default 0.25 = at most 1/4 of the
            sweep can be saturated.
        min_stdev: Lower bound on the stdev of the sweep's output. Default
            0.005 = output must spread at least ~1pp on the p_up scale.
        max_direction_skew: Upper bound on max(n_up, n_down) /
            (n_up + n_down). Default 0.85 = at most 85% same direction.
        floor: Calibrator floor clip value. Default 0.011 (1pp tolerance
            above isotonic's hard 0.01 floor for round-tripping).
        ceiling: Calibrator ceiling clip value. Default 0.989 (similar
            tolerance below 0.99 hard ceiling).

    Audit Phase 2a-PROMOTE Option C (2026-05-07): the synthetic-sweep
    variant catches calibrator-internal failures (isotonic plateaus,
    floor clipping); the live-batch variant catches degenerate live
    output. Both can pass while the model collapses in only one regime
    (e.g. healthy IC + non-degenerate output in bull/neutral, but in
    bear regime the Ridge output lands entirely in a calibrator flat
    region). Aggregate-pool gates miss this; a per-regime stratified
    gate catches it.

    Per audit §9.2: "C catches the cross-regime failure class that B
    (synthetic) can't see. **B + C together catch all four recent
    incidents at the gate.** A or D alone catches at most three."

    Designed to be called from training/meta_trainer.py after the
    composite IC + synthetic-sweep gates pass. Inputs are the same OOS
    rows the existing horizon-IC diagnostic uses, with predictions
    already calibrated and a regime label attached per row.

    Pass semantics:
      - All regimes with >= ``min_per_regime_size`` rows must individually
        pass all four invariants.
      - Regimes with < ``min_per_regime_size`` rows are SKIPPED with a
        note in the metrics — too few rows to make a meaningful
        per-regime call. This matches the audit's "don't confuse
        low-sample noise with signal" framing.
      - If every regime is below ``min_per_regime_size``, the gate
        returns ``passed=True`` with a metrics dict indicating
        "insufficient stratified sample" — operator decides whether
        the training corpus is too narrow.

    Fail semantics:
      - Returns ``passed=False`` with ``failed_check`` formatted as
        ``"{regime}/{check}"`` (e.g. ``"bear/unique_p_up"``).
      - ``reason`` includes the regime name explicitly so operators
        immediately know which regime collapsed.
      - ``metrics`` carries per-regime invariant results regardless
        of pass/fail, so a borderline-pass regime over multiple
        training cycles is itself a useful trend signal.

    Args:
        predictions: list of prediction dicts (same shape as
            ``validate_live_batch_distribution`` input — must have
            ``p_up`` and ``predicted_direction``).
        regimes: parallel list of regime labels (one per prediction).
            Each label must be one of ``"bull"`` / ``"neutral"`` /
            ``"bear"``; other labels are tolerated but bucketed into
            ``"other"`` and excluded from the per-regime check.
        min_per_regime_size: minimum rows required for a regime to
            participate. Default 25 — fewer rows than that and the
            within-regime stdev / uniqueness checks are too noisy.
