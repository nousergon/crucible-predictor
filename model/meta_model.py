model/meta_model.py — Meta-model that stacks Layer 1 specialized model outputs.

Ridge regression that learns the optimal combination of:
  - Research calibrator P(signal correct)
  - Momentum model score
  - Volatility model expected move
  - Regime predictor P(bull), P(bear)
  - Research composite score and context

Intentionally simple (ridge, not GBM) to avoid overfitting on ~10 inputs.
Trained on out-of-fold predictions from Layer 1 walk-forward validation.
