"""
tests/test_walk_forward_calibrator.py — Source-text and behavioral checks
for per-fold research_calibrator fitting (PR #56, 2026-04-28).

Pre-PR-#56 the calibrator was fit ONCE on the full ``score_performance``
history before the walk-forward loop and reused across every fold. That
allowed forward outcomes (post-train_end_date beat_spy_21d entries) to
shape ``research_calibrator_prob`` for earlier folds — minor leakage
that PR #55 explicitly noted as a follow-up. PR #56 fits a fold-local
calibrator inside the walk-forward loop using only score_performance
entries dated ``<= train_end_date``.
