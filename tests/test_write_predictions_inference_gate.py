"""Tests for the inference-time gate wired into write_predictions.

Per the 2026-05-07 predictor audit Phase 2a-INFER (companion to
test_output_distribution_gate_live_batch.py): the gate is called from
``inference/stages/write_output.py:write_predictions`` before any S3
write. Behind a feature flag (default OFF). When the flag is True and
the gate fails, write_predictions raises RuntimeError without writing
to S3 — fail-closed semantics.
