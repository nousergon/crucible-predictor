"""Pins spot_train.sh `--preflight-only` to the Friday shell_run dry-path
hard invariant: boot + import/lib-pin + read-only ArcticDB connectivity
probe, then `exit 0` BEFORE the smoke step and BEFORE the full-training
step — with NO model training, NO weight promotion, and ZERO S3/config
writes.

Owed-item #2 of ROADMAP "Friday shell-run — per-module dry-path
activation" (P1). Static-analysis test (mirrors
test_spot_train_aws_region.py) — the spot_train.sh path is SSM/EC2 and
cannot be exercised in CI; these assertions guard the structural
invariant against a future edit that would let preflight-only fall
through into training.
