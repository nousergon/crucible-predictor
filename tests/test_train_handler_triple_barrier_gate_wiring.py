"""Source-level regression tests for Stage 3 PR 5: cutover-gate SF wiring.

Pins the train_handler tail call that invokes the triple-barrier cutover
gate after model upload + training-summary write. Mirrors the
source-level regression style used by ``test_meta_trainer_triple_barrier.py``.

The wiring contract:
- Step 2e runs AFTER step 2d (training summary write) and BEFORE step 3
  (training email send) so the gate result can be merged into the
  ``result`` dict for email surfacing.
- Failure is non-blocking — wrapped in try/except with a WARNING log;
  the gate is observe-only until ``triple_barrier.enforce_cutover`` flips
  in alpha-engine-config (PR 6 of the arc).
- Default knobs: 42-day window, 21-day horizon, 1.15 relative-lift
  threshold (LdP institutional default).

Plan: alpha-engine-docs/private/triple-barrier-260510.md.
