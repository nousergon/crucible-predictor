"""
Training preflight — connectivity + freshness checks run at the top of
``train_handler.main`` before any download or training work starts.

Primitives live in ``nousergon_lib.preflight.BasePreflight``; this
module only composes them into a training-specific sequence. Matches
the ``PredictorPreflight`` pattern (inference/preflight.py) but with
training-specific checks.

Runs on EC2 spot instance at training start. Raises ``RuntimeError``
up through ``train_handler.main()`` → non-zero exit → spot_train.sh
fails visibly → flow-doctor dispatches.
