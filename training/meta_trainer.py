    Why this matters: the existing horizon IC diagnostic in this trainer
    samples (date, ticker) rows with a forward window that overlaps heavily
    across consecutive dates — at h=21d, today's training row and tomorrow's
    share 20 of 21 days of forward return. That autocorrelation inflates IC
    point estimates compared to honest non-overlapping samples and makes
    cross-horizon IC ratios (e.g. "21d IC = 2.2× 5d IC") harder to interpret
    cleanly. Per the 2026-05-07 predictor audit Track B, the right fix is
    to compute IC on both overlapping (current) and non-overlapping samples
    so the autocorrelation contribution is visible.

    Strategy: walk the sorted unique dates ascending; greedily keep a date
    if it's at least ``horizon_trading_days`` calendar days past the most
    recently kept date. Calendar-day spacing is a good proxy for trading-day
    spacing at these horizons (5/10/15/21/40/60/90) and avoids needing the
    NYSE calendar in this hot path. Returns a mask aligned to ``dates``.

    The greedy "keep-if-far-enough" pattern minimizes overlap pessimistically:
    dates dropped because their forward window overlapped with a kept date's
    are simply not used for IC computation at that horizon. The cost is
    sample-size; the benefit is honest IC on independent observations.

    This is a single-feature heuristic chosen for transparency. The retired

    #      reads at runtime via research_calibrator.json.
    #   2. ``fold_calibrator`` — fit per fold inside the walk-forward loop
    #      below using only score_performance entries dated <= train_end_date.
    #      Used to compute research_calibrator_prob for that fold's test rows
    #      so the meta-model never sees forward-looking calibration during
    #      training (the leakage that the original 2026-04-28 fix accepted
    #      and PR #56 closes).

    # "earns-its-complexity" signal this subsample gate did. The bucket-
    # lookup remains as a degraded fallback for cycles where the GBM fit
    # is skipped (n_finite < 100); a fallback path doesn't need its own

    # short signals history, so the join would drop every row → the 0-rows

    # The bucket-lookup ResearchCalibrator (prod_calibrator from Step 5b)

    #
    # Training shape: same OOS rows the meta-Ridge consumes (each row has
    # all 9 RESEARCH_GBM_FEATURES + multi-horizon labels from Track B).
    # Label is binary beat-SPY-at-10d (`actual_fwd_10d > 0`) — same target
    # the bucket-lookup is graded on. WF isolation: rows are date-sorted
    # and we split 80/20 temporally for early-stopping validation.
    #
    # Caveat (PR 4 cutover, 2026-05-09): at ~24 weeks of labeled history
    # (~797 OOS rows) per-fold WF GBM training is infeasible — early folds
    # would have <50 rows of feature-matrix to train a 9-feature LGB.
    # Today's cutover accepts in-sample predictions on training rows for
    # Ridge fit purposes; the GBM's val_ic measures the OOS gap. Manifest
    # emits both train_ic and val_ic so the gap can be monitored. Per-fold

    # ── Step 7b: Fit direction calibrator on meta OOS predictions ────────────
    # ROADMAP P1: collapse FLAT, use calibrated P(UP) as confidence.
    #
    # Input: continuous meta-model output on the pooled OOS rows. These
    # predictions are OOS with respect to the Layer-1 base models
    # (momentum/volatility/regime were held out by fold) but are
    # in-sample for the meta ridge itself, which was just fit on meta_X.
    # Pure nested CV would be cleaner; the pragmatic tradeoff is that
    # ridge has low capacity (8 coefficients) and overfits minimally, so
    # in-sample meta predictions are a reasonable calibration substrate.
    #
    # Output: P(actual_fwd > 0 | meta prediction). Binary target from
    # sign(meta_y), continuous input → calibrated probability (no sigmoid
    # wrapper needed for either method).
    #
    # Method is config-driven via cfg.CALIBRATION_METHOD (predictor.yaml
    # ``calibration.method``) — "platt" (L2-regularised logistic, the
    # tail-robust default) or "isotonic". ROADMAP L1873: the 2026-05-09
    # 75%+ DOWN-veto inversion was isotonic-tail overconfidence; "platt"
    # is the prescribed tail-robust fix. This call site previously
    # hardcoded "isotonic", silently ignoring the config (the knob was
    # dead — parsed at config.py but never read), so the committed
    # ``platt`` default never took effect. Honour the config here.

    # Tier 0 implementation (multinomial logistic on 6 macro features) could
    # not clear an honest baseline — walk-forward OOS accuracy of 39.5% sat
    # below always-predict-majority (~49%), with bear recall of 0.23 under
    # balanced class weights. Raw macro features now feed the meta ridge
    # directly via MACRO_FEATURE_META_MAP above. Tier 1 regime rewrite
    # (LightGBM + broader features + triple-barrier labeling + proper purge
    # ≥ label horizon) is tracked in the roadmap; when it ships, it will
    # enter the stack through a dedicated promotion gate referencing named
    # baselines (majority-class, random, persistence) rather than absolute
    # thresholds.

    # Research calibrator (`prod_calibrator`) was fitted earlier in Step 5b
    # so it could be consumed during walk-forward row construction. By this
    # point it is already in its final form; nothing to do here.

    # each base model's walk-forward median to be strictly positive. The

    # combine out-of-sample; double-gating on per-base-model walk-forward
    # blocks legitimate promotions when one base is weak but the blend is
    # strong.
    #
    # 2026-04-11 regression the new gate fixes: meta-model IC was 0.0525
    # (well above the 0.02 gate), volatility walk-forward 0.33 median with
    # 12/12 positive folds, but momentum walk-forward was -0.0017. The old
    # strict-positive gate blocked promotion, leaving gbm_latest.txt at a

    # passing candidates. Silent alpha cap on every daily inference.
